## Challenge

**Getting Article data from the PlateJS** : This was the most challenging thing because I PlateJS does not support getting value from it anytime. I used onChange event to implement it.

**Setting initial data to the PlateJS** : It is challenging because there are two types of articles in editor - new article and updating article. I used useEffect hook to solve it.
